Description: Predictive scores must be updated with care, because actions taken on the basis of existing risk scores causes bias in risk estimates from the updated score. A holdout set is a straightforward way to manage this problem: a proportion of the population is 'held-out' from computation of the previous risk score. This package provides tools to estimate a size for this holdout set and associated errors. Comprehensive vignettes are included.
